### **Application to Renew Hotel Licence**

The Hotel licence to operate a hotel will expire on 31 December every year, regardless of the date of licence issuance. A Certificate of Registration and Hotel-Keeper's licence are required under the Hotels Act to operate a hotel.

Applications for the renewal of the Certificate of Registration and Hotel-keeper's licence and the payment of the fees will be open during the last quarter of the calendar year. Licensees will be notified by post and email on the renewal application process and requirements.

> Note:
> * Should there be a change of Hotel-Keeper, change of Hotel-Name or hotel details in the renewal application, these changes will only take effect 1 Jan of the following year.
> * If the changes are to be effected for the current year, please see the requirements as stated under the [Change of Hotel-Keeper](https://datagovsg.github.io/blueprint-hlb/application-guidelines/change-of-hotel-keeper/) or [Change of Hotel-Name](https://datagovsg.github.io/blueprint-hlb/application-guidelines/change-of-hotel-name/).
